Missing Persons, as is the working title for our game, is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling, open-world, role-playing game in which the player controls a knight on a quest to find and bring back the missing prince or princess (as chosen by the player) to the castle.

Along their journey, the knight will come across evil creatures and mysterious characters looking to help or harm their progress.

The underlying tone to the game, which is given by subtle clues and textual deduction, is to help teenagers identify the behaviors and dangers of sexual predators and how to avoid those scenarios.
