Missing Persons, as is the currently active title for our game, is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling, open-world, role-playing game in which the player controls a Knight on a quest to find and bring back the prince or princess (as chosen by the player) to the castle. Along his journey, the knight comes across evil creatures and mysterious characters to help or hurt his adventure. 
    
The underlying tone to the game, which is given by subtle clues and textual deduction, is to help teenagers identify the behaviors and dangers of sexual predators, and how to better keep themselves away from those scenarios.
